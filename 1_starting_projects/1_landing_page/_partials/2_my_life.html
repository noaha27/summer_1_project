                         I was born in Oakland where I spent a part of my infancy before moving to an apartment in Alameda where I was for a year. When I was about 2 years old I moved to Pinole where I still live today. I attend St. Joseph School for 9 years and will be attending either St. Mary's or Berkeley High.

                            I discovered Computer Science on a thorough level when I was about 11 years old and I knew I loved it. The power to create was just so appealind to me. I started off with scratch which bored me as it got too easy. I then moved on too HTML, which I persued for a while but started Python because I was told that it was beginner friendly and you could do far more with it. I started teaching myself how to make small very simple games like a number guessing game and Pong. I also was interesting in entrepreneurship for a very long time. I was inspired by the combination of tech and entrepreneurship, oddly enough, when I first saw the Social Network. It is about the start of Facebook. I found the movie very interesting and decided that this may be what I want to try to persue in my life.
