                                <!-- $$$ Below Indentify What Stands Out To You About The Hidden Genius Project Mission Statement   $$$ -->

                              There are many things that stand out to me in the Hidden Genius Project Mission statement.

                                <strong>
                                    <em>
                                        "The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors black male youth..."
                                    </em>
                                </strong>

                                I like this one because I feel this is one of the best ways to improve the black community. By preparing black youth for the next stages in life they are making one of the biggest changes in their lives in my opinion.


                                <strong>
                                    <em>
                                        "...in technology creation, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities."



                                    </em>
                                </strong>
                                I like this one because it describes skills that most black youth are deprived of knowing about. With these skills they can transform their lives and communities because these are the skills we need to bring wealth to our communities in the future.
