                  <!-- $$$ Below Indentify Why You Joined The Hidden Genius Project  $$$ -->
  
  I am going to highlight a few reasons why I joined the Hidden Genius Project. My first reson is entrepreneurship. I have always had the dream of not really having a boss and not working in the cubicle of a corporate company. You can see why entrepreneurship stood out to me.

                  </a>
                 My second reason is the fact that I have been interested in computer science for a while. Computer Science is great because it gives me the power to create without relying on other peoples creations. That is why it is such a valuable skill to have in my opinion. The third reason is because I feel that I will improve my Social Skills. Which is a skill that will help me succeed
